# In this exercise you will train a CNN on the FULL Cats-v-dogs dataset
# This will require you doing a lot of data preprocessing because
# the dataset isn't split into training and validation for you
# This code block has all the required inputs

# This code block downloads the full Cats-v-Dogs dataset and stores it as 
# cats-and-dogs.zip. It then unzips it to /tmp
# which will create a tmp/PetImages directory containing subdirectories
# called 'Cat' and 'Dog' (that's how the original researchers structured it)

# Write a python function called split_data which takes
# a SOURCE directory containing the files
# a TRAINING directory that a portion of the files will be copied to
# a TESTING directory that a portion of the files will be copie to
# a SPLIT SIZE to determine the portion
# The files should also be randomized, so that the training set is a random
# X% of the files, and the test set is the remaining files
# SO, for example, if SOURCE is PetImages/Cat, and SPLIT SIZE is .9
# Then 90% of the images in PetImages/Cat will be copied to the TRAINING dir
# and 10% of the images will be copied to the TESTING dir
# Also -- All images should be checked, and if they have a zero file length,
# they will not be copied over
#
# os.listdir(DIRECTORY) gives you a listing of the contents of that directory
# os.path.getsize(PATH) gives you the size of the file
# copyfile(source, destination) copies a file from source to destination
# random.sample(list, len(list)) shuffles a list
